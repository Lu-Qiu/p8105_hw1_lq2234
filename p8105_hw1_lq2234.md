### Problem 1

Load the packages:

``` r
library(moderndive)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
```

Load the `early_january_weather` dataset:

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

Here is a short description of the dataset using inline R code:

- This dataset contains 15 variables, which are: origin, year, month,
  day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip,
  pressure, visib, time_hour.  
- This dataset has 358 rows and 15 columns.  
- The mean temperature is: 39.58.

Make a scatterplot of `temp` (y) vs `time_hour` (x):

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp)) + geom_point(aes(colour=humid)) + scale_x_datetime(date_breaks = "1 day")
```

![](p8105_hw1_lq2234_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png)<!-- -->
Patterns that are apparent in this plot:

- The temperature shows an increasing trend from 2013-01-01 to
  2013-01-15.  
- Within a single day, the temperature is highest at noon and lower
  during the morning and night.
- Within a single day, the humidity is highest at night.
- The overall humidity is high from 2013-01-12 to 2013-01-15.

Export the scatterplot to the project directory using ggsave:

``` r
ggsave("temp_time_scatter.png")
```

### Problem 2

Create a data frame comprised of:

- a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution
- a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater
  than 0
- a character vector of length 10
- a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

``` r
random_sample <- rnorm(10)
logical_vector <- random_sample > 0
character_vector <- c("Male", "Female", "Female", "Male", "Female", "Female", "Male", "Male", "Male", "Female")
factor_vector <- factor(rep(1:3, len = 10))
df <- data.frame(random_sample,
                 logical_vector,
                 character_vector,
                 factor_vector)
print(df)
```

    ##    random_sample logical_vector character_vector factor_vector
    ## 1    -0.68022102          FALSE             Male             1
    ## 2     0.18103010           TRUE           Female             2
    ## 3     1.59460518           TRUE           Female             3
    ## 4     0.59760043           TRUE             Male             1
    ## 5     0.92628278           TRUE           Female             2
    ## 6    -0.60663041          FALSE           Female             3
    ## 7    -0.25186302          FALSE             Male             1
    ## 8    -0.06115137          FALSE             Male             2
    ## 9    -0.76940127          FALSE             Male             3
    ## 10    0.72407462           TRUE           Female             1

The mean of the `random_sample` is 0.1654326.  
The mean of the `logical_vector` is 0.5.  
The mean of the `character_vector` is NA.  
The mean of the `factor_sample` is NA.

The mean of `random_sample` and `logical_vector`can be calculated, while
the mean of `character_vector` and `factor_sample` cannot be calculated.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(df,2))
as.numeric(pull(df,3))
as.numeric(pull(df,4))
```

What happens, and why?

- Applying as.numeric to a logical vector converts it to a numeric
  vector where TRUE becomes 1 and FALSE becomes 0. This conversion helps
  explain what happens when trying to take the mean. Because the mean of
  a numeric vector containing 0s and 1s makes sense, the logical vector
  is coerced to a numeric vector when using mean().
- Applying as.numeric to a character vector does not provide meaningful
  results because characters cannot be directly converted to numeric
  values. R converts each character to NA, and taking the mean of NA
  values will result in NA.  
- Applying as.numeric to a factor vector converts the factor levels to
  their underlying integer representation. Taking the mean of these
  integers does not have a meaningful interpretation, so the mean is
  also NA.
